# Migrating to Scala 3

This repo was also used to experiment with how to migrate from Scala 2.13 to 3.
In this experiment I learned there is a [comprehensive guide](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/compatibility-intro.html) available on migrations.

There is [tooling](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/tooling-tour.html) available to help in this effort,
and it is possible to migrate in an piecemeal fashion, such as per module in a project.

## Encountered Changes

Specifically, I had to tweak:
- Scalafmt config
- Scalafix configuration, by dropping Scala 2.X specific rules

That was all for this small repo.

## Further Experimentation

A few questions arose that I would like to see. 
Further experiments would include:
- attempting to upgrade a single submodule
- making scala 2.X work with an updated module
